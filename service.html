        <h2>Front-end</h2>
        <img src="images/t.jpg" alt="front end" class="desktop">
        <p>Going through some IT discussion forums I find that many of you are more or less wondering about the phrase "Front-end developer" next to some of you expressing quite smoothly about specific characteristics but still lack of ideas Some of you are still very vague about this area or in other words you are misunderstanding and do not know the nature of the industry. So today I am writing this article to better explain it to help you have a broad view and understand its core nature, f a few years ago Front-end (FE) was understood as the process of handling the look of a web page from fonts, colors to drop-down menus and sliders using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that definition is almost wrong in the modern world. Why so? Before entering the lesson, we have to understand at a minimum:

Front-End: takes charge of the display interface to the device clients.
Before broadband internet (around 2007) and powerful devices were developed today FE really played a very limited role in displaying the interface for users, then the actual need was How to make a display application is enough besides how to make Performance (performance) highly effective so that users do not feel the delay (shock) or load (load) is slow. The burden now weighed heavily on the Back-End remarkably.</p>

        <img src="images/c.jpg" alt="back end" class="desktop">
        <p>To become a Back end developer, you need to know the server side language as well as know how to manipulate the database:

Server-side language for writing back-end: C #, Java, Python, Ruby, .... Of course it must include knowledge of web frameworks that come with these languages: ASP.NET MVC, Spring, Django, Rails ...
Knowledge of database SQL: MS SQL Server, MySQL, ... Recently some NoSQL databases are quite popular: Neo4j, MongoDB, ...
Web knowledge in general, how to write Web Service, how to log in and decentralize.
Knowledge of some CMS: WordPress, Joomla, Umbraco, .. </p>

        <p>The key job role of a back-end developer is to ensure that the data or services requested by the front-end system or software are delivered through programmatic means. Back-end developers also create and maintain the entire back-end of a system, which consists of the core application logic, databases, data and application integration, API and other back-end processes. Moreover, a back-end developer performs the testing and debugging of any back-end application or system.</p>

        <p>A developer may specialize in a certain video game console (such as Nintendo's Nintendo Switch, Microsoft's Xbox One, Sony's PlayStation 4), or may develop for a number of systems (including personal computers and mobile devices).[citation needed] Video-game developers specialize in certain types of games (such as role-playing video games or first-person shooters). Some focus on porting games from one system to another, or translating games from one language to another. Less commonly, some do software-development work in addition to games.</p>
